📚 Erlang Algorithm Project
Welcome to the Erlang Algorithm Project! This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in Erlang, organized alphabetically by topic. Whether you're studying algorithms or just want to explore efficient solutions, this project provides an extensive library to learn from! 🎉

🌟 Project Structure
Each algorithm is implemented in its own Erlang file, and the code is organized alphabetically. This way, you can easily navigate and find algorithms based on their first letter.
